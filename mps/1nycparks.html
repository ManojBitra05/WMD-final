				<h2>Project Background</h2>
				<p>NYC Parks is in charge of more than 30,000 acres of land, which is about 14% of New York City.<br>
					This includes more than 5,000 different properties, such as Coney Island Beach, Central Park,
					community gardens, and Greenstreets. nycgovparks.org is designed to show information about parks in
					and around New York, including park history, activities, park events, opportunities to get involved,
					and other services.</p>

				<h2>Heuristic Reviews</h2>
				<p>As part of our UX research process, we conducted a heuristic review of the NYC Parks mobile app to
					identify potential usability issues and areas for improvement. Using the Jeff Rubin Severity Scale,
					we evaluated each issue based on its severity and likelihood to impact the user experience.</p>
				<div class="severity-scale">
					<h3>Severity Scale</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>4: Unusable:</strong> The user is not able to or will not want to use a particular
							part of the product because of the way that the product has been designed and implemented.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>3: Severe:</strong> The user will probably use or attempt to use the product here,
							but will be severely limited in his or her ability to do so.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>2: Moderate:</strong> The user will be able to use the product in most cases, but
							will have to undertake some moderate effort in getting around the problem.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>1: Irritant:</strong> The problem occurs only intermittently, can be circumvented
							easily, or is dependent on a standard that is outside the product’s boundaries. Could also
							be a cosmetic problem.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Conducting the Test</h2>
				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>By conducting the usability test, we hope to enhance the website's usability and make it more
					effective and user-friendly.</p>
				<h3>Research Questions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>How do users look for park events and register?</li>
					<li>How do users make a donation?</li>
					<li>How are users able to purchase brand merchandise?</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/NYC parks/1nyccondtresqus1.png" alt="Introductory Questions Image" class="test-image">
				<h3>Participants</h3>
				<p>The main traits of the participants should be those of nature lovers who enjoy spending time outside
					in parks and public areas. All age groups visit the parks, so we can choose the 18–45 age range as
					the best fit for the study. Total Number of Participants: 6</p>
				<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Six people from different groups and backgrounds took part in a moderated usability test.</li>
					<li>Each participant will have a 30-minute session that includes a short introduction, an interview,
						a task on nycgovparks.org, and a debriefing.</li>
					<li>The tasks are to look for park events and register, make donations and purchase merchandise.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="img/NYC parks/1nyccondtresqus2.png" alt="Introductory Questions Image" class="test-image">
				<h3>Test Plan Introductory Questions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>We’ll first start with your name, age, and where you live at the moment, including your
						occupation.</li>
					<li>What experience do you have with New York City parks? How often would you say you go to parks in
						the city?</li>
					<li>Have you ever accessed the https://www.nycgovparks.org/ website before? Do you know what it
						looks like?</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/NYC parks/Introductory Questions Image.png" alt="Introductory Questions Image"
					class="test-image">
				<h3>Tasks as Part of Test Plan</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>Task 1</h4>
						<p>You are interested in attending an event at a New York City park and would like to inquire
							about event details in order to decide what event will most suit your needs. Please show me
							how you would go about doing that on the website.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Task 2</h4>
						<p>You are an avid park-goer and would like to donate $35 to nycgovparks. Please go ahead and
							attempt to do that, up until the payment details page.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Task 3</h4>
						<p>You want to look at park merchandise and are thinking about buying something. Please show me
							how you would go about doing that.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Follow-Up Questions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>How would you describe the ease of which you navigated the website?</li>
					<li>In the future, if you were interested in looking for park information, would you consider
						accessing this website?</li>
					<li>What was your favorite part of the website, if you have one?</li>
					<li>What was your least favorite part of the website? What would you change about it?</li>

			<section id="recommendations">
				<h2>Recommendations</h2>
				<h3>Task 1</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>More pictures would break up the monotony of the list format
					</li>
					<li>Events should be immediately excluded upon finishing
					</li>
					<li>Users should be able to choose what area of the city you are interested in
					</li>
					<li>Emphasis on what’s best for kids is a good feature that should be implemented for different age
						groups

					<li>Events should be immediately excluded upon finishing

				</ol>
				<div class="recommendations-gallery">
					<img src="img/NYC parks/rec2 (1).png" alt="recommendations-1">
				</div>
				<h3>Task 3</h3>
				<ol>

					<li>Use a different term for “Shop Parks” so it's less confusing
					</li>
					<li>Events should be immediately excluded upon finishing
					</li>
					<li>Should make it clear that visitors can only purchase merchandise at the parks (not online)
					</li>
					<li>Should include images and description of the items
					</li>
					<li>Only 5 images of randomly selected merch and is not in gallery mode
					</li>
					<li>Only the map product is linked to another page- creates some confusion about what is available
						and what is not.
					</li>
					<li>Confusing to navigate as it is in the same list format that is implemented throughout the
						website
					</li>
